## Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL 💡
SQL and NoSQL are two different systems used to store data. Both store data, but they do it in different ways.

Data Structure 🗂️

SQL: Data is organized in tables (rows and columns). There are clear relationships between tables. The schema is predefined and fixed.

NoSQL: Data is more flexible; it can be stored as documents (JSON), key-value pairs, graphs, or other formats. Schema is either absent or flexible.

Query Language 📝

SQL: Uses a standardized, powerful language called SQL. Complex queries and relationships are easy to handle.

NoSQL: Each NoSQL database has its own query method. Complex joins like in SQL are generally not supported.

Scalability 📈

SQL: To improve performance, you typically upgrade to a more powerful server (vertical scaling). Horizontal scaling is difficult for large data.

NoSQL: Data is distributed by increasing the number of servers (horizontal scaling). It’s suitable for large and fast-growing datasets.

Data Consistency 🔒

SQL: Data is always consistent and guarantees accuracy (ACID). Preferred in systems like banking.

NoSQL: Sometimes relaxes consistency for better performance (Eventual consistency). Data may not update immediately but becomes consistent over time.

Use Cases 🛠️

SQL: Systems with structured data and complex relationships where data integrity is critical.

NoSQL: Applications requiring flexible data structures and rapid growth; social media, big data, real-time analytics.
