## 🔍⭐What does a backend developer do, and how is it different from frontend?
A backend developer works on the parts of a software or web application that users don’t see. That includes the logic behind the scenes, data management, user sessions, security, APIs, and database operations.

While frontend developers build the interface users interact with, backend developers make sure that this interface works properly by handling the data and logic it needs.

For example, when a user submits a form, it’s the backend system that processes that data — validating, storing, and sometimes analyzing it.

I personally chose the backend path because I enjoy working with logic and data. Solving complex problems and building the foundation of a system feels more meaningful and exciting to me.

## 🔍⭐What is a REST API and what is it used for?
A REST API is a structure that allows different systems to communicate with each other. It's especially used so the frontend and backend can exchange data.

REST stands for "Representational State Transfer" and works over the HTTP protocol. An API is like a communication gateway that lets an application talk to the outside world.

✅For example, when a user wants to view a list of products through the app interface, the frontend sends this request to the backend via a REST API. The backend receives the request, processes it, fetches the data from the database, and sends it back to the frontend.

Thanks to REST APIs, systems can work independently from each other. This makes the software easier to scale and manage.

## 🔍⭐What are HTTP methods? What are they used for? (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
HTTP methods allow a client (usually the frontend) to tell the server (backend) what action it wants to perform.

Here’s a brief explanation of the four most commonly used HTTP methods:

GET: Used to retrieve data from the server. For example, when we want to view a list of products, the frontend sends a GET request to the backend.

POST: Used to send and save new data to the server. For instance, submitting a registration form is done via a POST request.

PUT: Used to completely update existing data. For example, updating a user's profile information is done using PUT.

DELETE: Used to delete specific data from the server. For example, deleting a user account.

✅These methods help ensure clear and organized communication between the frontend and backend. In REST APIs, we use these methods to perform different operations in a standardized way.

<hr style="border: 50px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

## 🔍⭐What is the difference between POST and PUT?
Both POST and PUT are used to send data to the server, but their purposes and typical use cases are different.

POST is usually used to create new data. For example, when submitting a user registration form, we use POST. The server creates a new user.

PUT is used to update existing data. For instance, if we want to change a user’s email address, we use PUT.

One key difference is:

POST can create a new record every time it is called (like a new object with a different ID).

PUT updates the content of an existing record with a specific ID, keeping the ID the same.

✅In short:
→ POST = Create.
→ PUT = Update.

<hr style="border: 50px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

## 🔍⭐What is Stateless Architecture?
A stateless architecture means that each request from a client to a server is independent. The server does not remember any previous requests.

Every request must contain all necessary information (like authentication data and parameters), because the server treats each request as if it comes for the first time.
Example:
Think of a REST API. Every GET or POST request must include information like who you are and what you want. Even if the server responded to your previous request, it won't remember it for the next one.
✅Benefits:
The server becomes scalable, as it doesn’t store user sessions.
Load balancing is easier.
The system is faster, simpler, and easier to maintain.

<hr style="border: 50px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

## 🔍⭐What is the MVC(Model-View-Controller) Architecture and Why is it Used?

MVC is a software architecture divided into three main components:

Model (Data and Business Logic)
Contains all the data, rules, and business logic of the application. Communication with the database, data processing, and rules are handled in this layer.

View (User Interface)
This is the interface with which the user interacts. Visual designs, buttons, forms—everything displayed to the user—belongs to this layer.

Controller
Handles requests from the user, communicates with the appropriate Model, and sends the result to the View. In essence, it acts as a bridge between the Model and the View.

-----✅WHY USE MVC?-----
1. Separation of Concerns
Each component has its own responsibility. This makes the code more understandable, organized, and easier to maintain. For example, if the interface changes, updating just the View is enough.

2. Improved Testability
Since the Model and Controller are separate, it's easier to test individual units. This is a big advantage in large projects where automated testing is important.

3. Reusability
The same data (Model) can be used with different interfaces (View) multiple times. For example, the same user information can be displayed in different ways on different pages.

4. Facilitates Parallel Development in Teams
While frontend developers work on the View, backend developers can work on the Model and Controller. This increases team productivity.

5. Scalable Architecture
As the application grows, it's easier to expand parts or add new components. It's especially ideal for projects that require modular design.

<hr style="border: 50px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

## 🔍⭐What are Request and Response?
Request and Response define the communication between the client and the server in web-based systems. A Request is the message sent by the client to the server. This request typically includes actions such as viewing a page, sending data, or retrieving information. For example, when a user accesses a website, the browser sends a GET request to the server to retrieve the page content.

Once the server receives this request, it processes it and sends back a Response. This response could be an HTML page, a JSON object, an error message, or any other type of result.

In short: a Request represents the client's demand, while a Response is the server's reply to that demand. This pair forms the foundation of modern web applications. Communication usually takes place over the HTTP or HTTPS protocols, and each step follows specific rules.

Thanks to this structure, the actions users perform through a browser can be understood, processed, and responded to by the server.

## 🔍⭐HTTP Status Codes (200, 201, 400, 401, 403, 404, 500)
HTTP status codes are numerical indicators that show how a request from the client was handled by the server.
Each code indicates whether the request was successful, contained errors, or requires further action.

200 – OK
The request was successfully processed, and the server returned the expected response.
Example: When requesting a product list, the server returns the list in JSON format.

201 – Created
The request was successful, and the server created a new resource.
Example: Submitting a registration form that results in a new user being created.

400 – Bad Request
The request is invalid, incomplete, or cannot be understood by the server.
Example: Submitting a form with required fields left empty.

401 – Unauthorized
Authentication has not been provided or is invalid. Valid credentials are required for access.
Example: Sending a request to a protected API without logging in.

403 – Forbidden
Authentication is provided but the user does not have permission to access the resource.
Example: A regular user attempting to access the admin panel.

404 – Not Found
The requested resource could not be found on the server.
Example: Navigating to a non-existent URL.

500 – Internal Server Error
The server encountered an unexpected error while processing the request.
Example: A coding error or a database connection failure.

✅ Summary:

2xx → Successful operations

4xx → Client-side errors

5xx → Server-side errors

## 🔍⭐ What is API Versioning? Why is it Important?
API versioning is the method of managing different versions of an API over time.
As APIs evolve, new features are added, existing structures are modified, or removed.
This can cause applications that use the API to break.
API versioning allows us to make these changes in a controlled way, ensuring that existing users can continue to work without being affected.

Why is it Important?

🚀 Maintains backward compatibility

🚀 Allows new versions to be released without affecting users of older versions

🚀 Enables large changes to be rolled out step by step

🚀 Lets API consumers choose which version they want to use

🚀 Simplifies the development and maintenance process

🚀 Provides the ability to fix bugs or shortcomings in new versions

✅ In short, API versioning ensures that an API remains safe, compatible, and sustainable for both developers and users.

## ⚙️ What is Middleware? What Does It Do?
Middleware is software that sits between an application and client requests, processing these requests in a specific way before passing them to the next stage.
It typically operates between the request sent by the client and the response returned by the server.

Purposes of Middleware:

🚀 Filtering requests: For example, blocking users who have not completed authentication.

🛡️ Ensuring security: Handling authorization, data validation, and attack prevention.

📊 Logging and monitoring: Keeping a record of incoming API requests.

⚙️ Data processing: Modifying requests or responses (e.g., converting to JSON format).

🌐 CORS management: Controlling requests coming from different domains.

✅ In short: Middleware is a critical mechanism that intervenes at different stages of an application to ensure that requests are processed securely, correctly, and efficiently.

<hr style="border: 50px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

## 🔍⭐What is Rate Limiting and Why is it Important?
Rate limiting is the method of restricting the number of requests an API or system can accept within a specific time period.
Its purpose is to prevent system overload, enhance security, and ensure fair resource usage.

⚙️Why is it important?

🚀 Protects the system from excessive load.

🚀 Prevents brute-force and DDoS attacks.

🚀 Ensures fair resource sharing among users.

🚀 Helps manage cost and performance efficiently.

⚙️How is it implemented?

Token Bucket / Leaky Bucket: Each request consumes a token; if no tokens remain, the request is rejected.

Fixed Window: Allows a limited number of requests within a fixed time frame.

Sliding Window: Uses a moving time window for a fairer distribution of requests.
Example usage scenarios:

🚀 Limiting login attempts (e.g., maximum of 5 attempts within 5 minutes).

🚀 Setting different request limits for free and premium users.

🚀 Controlling requests to avoid exceeding third-party API limits.

✅Summary: Rate limiting is a critical mechanism for backend developers to ensure system performance, security, and stability. 

<hr style="border: 50px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

## ⚡What is Caching?
 Caching is the process of storing data temporarily in memory to access it faster. The goal is to avoid fetching the same data repeatedly from a slow source (such as a database or a remote API) by keeping it in memory and retrieving it in milliseconds instead. This improves performance 🚀, reduces database load 💾, and enhances the user experience .

In backend systems, caching typically works like this: When a request comes in, the system first checks the cache. If the data exists in the cache, it is returned directly. If not, the data is fetched from the database, stored in the cache, and then returned to the client. The amount of time the data stays in the cache is determined by TTL (Time To Live), ensuring that outdated data is automatically deleted or refreshed.

The most commonly used caching systems include Redis 🟥 and Memcached 🟩. In Java projects, Spring Boot Cache support makes integration straightforward.

📌 Key Considerations
Data Freshness: Cached data becomes stale over time. Configure TTL carefully ⏳.

Memory Management: Cache consumes memory; don’t let it grow without limits 💾.

Proper Use Cases: Ideal for frequently accessed, rarely changing data; inefficient for constantly changing data ⚠️.

Synchronization: Ensure consistency between the cache and the primary data source 🔄.

Eviction Strategies: Use algorithms like LRU (Least Recently Used) to remove unused data 🧹.

<hr style="border: 50px solid #4CAF50; margin: 20px 0;">

## Key Differences Between SQL and NoSQL 💡
SQL and NoSQL are two different systems used to store data. Both store data, but they do it in different ways.

Data Structure 🗂️

SQL: Data is organized in tables (rows and columns). There are clear relationships between tables. The schema is predefined and fixed.

NoSQL: Data is more flexible; it can be stored as documents (JSON), key-value pairs, graphs, or other formats. Schema is either absent or flexible.

Query Language 📝

SQL: Uses a standardized, powerful language called SQL. Complex queries and relationships are easy to handle.

NoSQL: Each NoSQL database has its own query method. Complex joins like in SQL are generally not supported.

Scalability 📈

SQL: To improve performance, you typically upgrade to a more powerful server (vertical scaling). Horizontal scaling is difficult for large data.

NoSQL: Data is distributed by increasing the number of servers (horizontal scaling). It’s suitable for large and fast-growing datasets.

Data Consistency 🔒

SQL: Data is always consistent and guarantees accuracy (ACID). Preferred in systems like banking.

NoSQL: Sometimes relaxes consistency for better performance (Eventual consistency). Data may not update immediately but becomes consistent over time.

Use Cases 🛠️

SQL: Systems with structured data and complex relationships where data integrity is critical.

NoSQL: Applications requiring flexible data structures and rapid growth; social media, big data, real-time analytics.
