📚 About

This repository is a personal archive consisting of fundamental concepts, technologies, code examples, and best practices I have learned during the software development process. I aim to store information in areas such as backend, game development, databases, and DevOps in an organized way and create a resource I can refer to when needed.

⸻----------------------------------------------------------------

🚀 Usage

Under the relevant folders of the topics you are interested in, you can find detailed notes and examples. This repository is regularly updated as I learn new technologies and concepts.

ℹ️ Note

This repository has been prepared entirely for personal learning purposes.
